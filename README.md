# First Tech Degree Project

This project is a random quote generator.
Whenever the browser refreshes, it prints a random quote from a list of array quotes.
In addition to the random quote that is printed, the background of the page also changes with each page reload automatically every 5 minutes.
If you are reviewing this project as a Treehouse Tech Degree Staff or student, I'll like to let you know I am aiming for **Exceeds Expectations Grade**.
